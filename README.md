# MultiphaseKinetics

Python implementation of multiphase kinetics models derived in: Wilson, Prophet & Willis, A Kinetic Model for Predicting Trace Gas Uptake and Reaction JPCA, 2022

[LambertW_TimeDependentKinetics.py] Uses the Lambert W function to solve time-dependent kinetics expressions for condensed phase reactants in spherical particles; corresponds to Equation 22a, 23a, 35 & 36 in Wilson, Prophet & Willis, A Kinetic Model for Predicting Trace Gas Uptake and Reaction JPCA, 2022.

[Uptake_SurfaceAndBulk.py] Computes effective uptake coefficient using expressions derived in Wilson, Prophet & Willis, A Kinetic Model for Predicting Trace Gas Uptake and Reaction JPCA, 2022; corresponds to Equations 10, 30 and 30a. 

Tested with Python 3.8.5
